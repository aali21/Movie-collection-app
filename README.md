# Udemy project: A movie collection app 
Allows users to:
 Markup : * Bullet list Add movies to a collection (so they can keep track of all their movies).
* Bullet list List all the movies in the collection (so that the iser can see what movies they already have).
* Bullet list Finding movies in the collection by name, year or director (so that the user can easily locate a specific movie once the collection grows).
