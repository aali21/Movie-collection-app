# Udemy project: A movie collection app 
#### Allows users to: ####
* Add movies to a collection (so they can keep track of all their movies).
* List all the movies in the collection (so that the user can see what movies they already have).
* Finding movies in the collection by name, year or director (so that the user can easily locate a specific movie once the collection grows).
